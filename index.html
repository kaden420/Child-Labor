<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>Child labor is bad, and we all know that. Many people think child labor is a thing of the past, but I am here too tell you those people are wrong... Child labor is still common and more intensive than ever in many countries worldwide. For example; in India, the Mica Mining companies do not want to pay their workers, so they hire small children and teenagers and force them to work in mines and mine for Mica all day instead of even going to school, and for all of that the big companies only pay their child workers 30-40 cents for an entire day's worth of mining in these unsafe conditions. Yet India is not the only country guilty of this, as there are still various other countries that still use child labor and force the children to work in unsafe work conditions for little to no pay. Child labor is still alive, and it needs to STOP </h3>
