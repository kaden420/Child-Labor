<h2>action</h2>
<p> The action we can take to end child labor is too pass a worldwide law through the UN that will make hiring manual laborers under the age of 18 illegal for all companies and manual buissness owners everywhere. the UN would have to stress this law and all countries worldwide would have governments that crack down hard on offenders of the law. Anyone who illegally hired a child for a manual labor job would be locked up for life. Furthermore, underpaying children and forcing children to lose their education time in order to attend their work should also be illegal worldwide. If the governments throughout planet earth abided and sctricly followed my proposed laws, then Child labor would end FOREVER! </p>
